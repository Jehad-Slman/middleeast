                    <h3>MEZZE!</h3>
                    <p>At the heart of this culinary tradition lies the concept of "mezze"â€”small plates bursting with flavour, designed to tantalise the taste buds and ignite conversation. From creamy hummus drizzled with olive oil to tangy tabbouleh bursting with fresh herbs, each dish tells a story of generations past, a tribute to the rich tapestry of Middle Eastern cuisine.</p>
